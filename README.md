The Weather Dashboard is a responsive React application that allows users to easily check real-time weather information for any location by inputting a city or region. The app fetches and displays detailed weather data from a reliable weather API, offering an intuitive and clean interface for users to access essential weather information quickly.

2.Detailed Weather Information: The app displays key metrics such as the current temperature, high/low forecast, feels-like temperature, wind conditions, air pressure, and more. It may also include weather icons for a more visual representation.

3.Forecast Display: In addition to current conditions, users can view a multi-day forecast to plan ahead, displaying temperature trends, and weather conditions for upcoming days.

4.Responsive Design: The app is optimized for different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

5.User-Friendly Interface: A clean and modern design makes it easy for users to interact with the app. Essential weather data is displayed prominently with clear icons and charts for easy understanding.

6.Error Handling: The app gracefully handles invalid city searches or API errors, providing helpful feedback such as “City not found” or “Unable to fetch data.”

7.Dynamic Updates: Weather data updates automatically based on the user's input, ensuring the information displayed is always fresh and accurate.
